I hate reading research papers as a stupid ass undergrad becasue theres so much stuff i dont know

I always end up needing to google a bunch of stuff to just read one paragraph

So I thought it would be nice to have some sort of "prerequisites" summary for a research paper

It's just an AI chat bot wrapper. I'm sorry. Hopefully I can add something that makes it more than *just* a wrapper. Hopefully.
